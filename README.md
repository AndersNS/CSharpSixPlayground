CSharpSixPlayground
===================

Just my personal playground for C# 6.0 things. The code here needs Visual Studio 2015 Preview to open. [You can download that from here](http://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-preview-vs). Alternatively you can use a text editor and the k and kpm commands. 

I write about some of these over at [my silly blog. ](http://andersns.com)
