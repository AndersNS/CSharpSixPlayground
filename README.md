CSharpSixPlayground
===================

Just my personal playground for C# 6.0 things. The code here needs Visual Studio 2014 CTP3 to open. [You can download hat from here](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/visual-studio-14-ctp-vs.aspx). Alternatively you can use a text editor and the k and kpm commands. 

I write about some of these over at [my silly blog. ](http://andersns.com)
